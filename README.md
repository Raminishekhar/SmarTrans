# SmarTrans
SmarTrans is a system developed to make the transit system efficient using information, communication,  and electronic technologies. It locates the real time coordinates of bus to passengers via user application using GPS so that they can determine when to go to the bus stop. Moreover sensors were installed at the base of bus-seats, so that seat occupancy of the public bus can be known. Thus it enables commuters to know beforehand how much occupied the bus is.

For this appication hardware was designed using Rhydolabz Sim900, Arduino Uno and Neo 6m GPS module.
